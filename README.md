# Description

This is a naive attempt to modify the original, to make it work with Matlab R2018b, Windows 10.
This proved to require re-building old LittleCMS, and some parts of code seem to be missing.
So, for now, I gave up.

# Gamutvision

Gamutvision™ is a gamut viewer and much more. It is a powerful tool for learning color management, exploring its functions, and proofing color workflows. With Gamutvision you can

## With Gamutvision you can
– View gamuts of color spaces, displays, and printers. 
– Visualize gamut mappings and rendering intents. 
– View color response for ANY saturation and lightness level, not just the gamut surface.   
– Evaluate ICC profile quality. 
– Preview printer, paper, and photo lab performance using downloaded profiles.  
– Analyze the performance of your printer using scanned test prints.   
– See precisely how image colors will change when printed.

## Who needs Gamutvision?
– Photographers: professional and prosumer
– Manufacturers and reviewers of printers, papers, and profiles

# Notes

This version was built with MATLAB 6.5.1 (R13 SP1) with only 32-bit *.dll libraries with the licensing system removed. It was tested with 32-bit MATLAB 2015a, but there is a bit of work needed in order to get Gamutvision running on a more modern version of MATLAB and hence Windows.
